- This is going to be a basic calculator GUI
- I am going to use Tkinter for the GUI
- I will use Python to make the math functions


Idea layout:

- first i drew out the calculator
    - the design was a tall rectangle
      with a 4x6 grid to hold all of the
      buttons.
    - the first row of the grid is for the
      visualization of the calculation.

Components:

title
number buttons + sizing/position
operation buttons + sizing/position
functions for operations
function for clearing (C)
function for enter (=)
connection enter function to proper space

To figure out more with Tkinter, I need to practice the basics, so I am going to do some practice in a
/practice.py file before finishing the /basic_calculator /main.py file.

8/8/23 LOG:

starting the basics of the calcualtor. i initiated the root
for the app and made the initial window for all the content
but I don't know how to lock in a certain width/height for
the window yet. I also tried to make the area that the solution
would appear in with a "Label". but it seems to be stuck in the
center of the GUI. I need to figure out if thats the best widget
option or not.

Good things so far:
created a root instance
created a window that pops up (kinda)
created a title for my calculator GUI
